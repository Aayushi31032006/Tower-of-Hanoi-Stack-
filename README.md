# 🗼 Tower of Hanoi Animation

This is a visual and interactive representation of the **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The animation visually demonstrates the logic behind the puzzle as disks are moved between three rods.

## 🧩 Project Features

- 3D-styled rods and disks using **CSS3**
- Smooth animations for disk movement
- Customizable number of disks
- Algorithm implemented in **JavaScript**
- Interactive or automatic solve options

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the puzzle
- **CSS3** – Styling rods, disks, and layout with 3D effects
- **JavaScript** – Logic for solving and animating the Tower of Hanoi

## 📁 File Structure

```
/tower-of-hanoi/
├── index.html         # Main HTML file
├── style.css          # CSS styles for rods and disks
└── script.js          # JavaScript logic and animation
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user selects the number of disks.
2. The `solveHanoi()` function calculates the steps using recursion.
3. Disks are animated from source to destination using `setTimeout` for timing.

## 🧠 Tower of Hanoi Rule Summary

- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.
- Only the top disk of any stack can be moved.

## 📦 Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tower-of-hanoi.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Watch the animation or interact with the puzzle.

## 🛠️ Customization

- You can change the number of disks in the input.
- Modify `style.css` to adjust colors or disk sizes.
- Enhance logic in `script.js` for user interaction.
